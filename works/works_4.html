                <h1>NYU Insider</h1>
                <p>For the final group project in my Communications Lab course we were split again into groups and tasked with making a film. Unlike the 30 minute film we made at the beginning this would be closer to a production film as we would use professional equipment as well having more time to produce our film. The story behind the film is that there is a Guru who has trained for years among other monks and is offering a course to achieve peace, but in reality it's all a scam and a bit absurd.</p>
                <h1>Inspiration</h1>
                <p>The way that we came up with the idea was a bit funny to be honest. Now it was deep into the semester and none of us really had any time so we met on Zoom and as we were discussing we thought about making a course for something imaginary/absurd and Redha (https://github.com/redhaalhammad) had mentioned something like "how to be a garden". From there sparked the idea to make a scam meditation course where the monk teaches you how to meditate out of your body and into a plant.</p>

                <h1>How We made the website</h1>
                <p>First after ideating I was in charge of making the storyboard since I was most familiar with how the film should go and because I was so familiar I had to act. I enjoyed acting as a scam artist... weirdly, but what I didn't enjoy as much was capturing the footage in the heat. We, as in Redha: https://github.com/redhaalhammad, Vahagn: https://github.com/Vayer88, and Tin: https://github.com/tinhngo split into three categories, acting (me), recording audio (Tin & Vahagn), and filming (Redha). Fortunately Redha had some experience in Photography so it made all our lives easier, and Tin and Vahagn did a good job recording the audio, Vahagn would often hold the mic with Tin listening to make sure it was all good. Then when it came to the website Vahagn played a big part making it, the rest of us suggested ideas and it seemed easy for him to make the website.</p>
                <h1>Future</h1>
                <p>Like every project theres always something that we learned. For me filming, storyboarding, directing, and acting at that level was new to me. I had some experience storyboarding and maybe some filming from using my phone as well as the first project but directing was new. I did my best to not just get my idea across in such a way that everyone understood the perspective of the Guru and the general theme of the film while also doing my best to hear what they had to say. </p> 
                <p>It's safe to say that I was far from perfect, but I noticed that as we went on it seemed that each of us got a clearer and clearer idea of what the website is going to look like and what the idea was. For example when it came to filming the student scene where Vahagn collapses I noticed that Vahagn really liked the idea and without me having to explain he understood and enjoyed adding to it. The same is true for Redha, when capturing B-Roll or establishing shots he understood how to capture everything within the grid and my personal favourite are the scenes of the student (Vahagn) after he collapses. I only asked to Redha to get some other angles of the student when he collapses, and didnt mention anything else and what he delivered was really good. Tin also contributed a lot even though it may not be obvious in the film. Other than the Audio (which is already a big help) she helped a lot when it came to renting the equipment, returning it, and keeping it safe, I would argue that is probably that she played the most vital part in the entire production.</p>
