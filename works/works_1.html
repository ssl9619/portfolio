                <h1>NYU Insider</h1>
                <p>As part of a project from my Communications Lab course we were divided into groups then each of us had to come up with an idea for a film, film it, and then edit it all within 30 minutes. For my film I along with my partner decided to make a film that was a tour of the university, more specifically the campus center.</p>

                <h1>Inspiration</h1>
                <p>After doing that, each individual was tasked with making a website that somehow linked to our films. For my website I decided to make a website that was about students in NYUAD who were giving an honest review and information about the university so that people from the outside could have realistic expectations and that they were also anonymous. That was the idea behind the name NYU Insider</p>
                <h1>How I made the website</h1>
                <p>The way in which I made the website was simple. Using Visual Studio Code as my code editor I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make the website. While I did have some experience programming before in languages such as Java, this was my first time really coding a website. It took a lot more time than I really had and while I really liked the idea behind it, I couldn't meet my own expectations</p>
                <h1>Future</h1>
                <p>This was a big learning experience for me. I came away from this project slightly upset but I learned a lot about web development that I didn't before. Going forwards I had a better idea of how HTML and CSS work together but realistically most of what I learned a lot of syntax </p>
