                <h1>Overtime</h1>
                <p>As part of another project from my Communications Lab course we were, again, divided into groups, this time was different however. Rather than making a film we were tasked with making a comic strip. Before we were even split up into groups I had the idea of the comic, and the idea was that there was an employee who goes to work day after day and he hates his job, and he has a terrible boss that he hates so much that he ends up killing him and is sent to prison. Then the website also allows for different endings based on your choices.</p>

                <h1>Inspiration</h1>
                <p>The idea of an employee who hates his job is cliche at this point. In an era where large corporations are more larger, and more common than ever its natural that many people feel they live meaningless lives and feel resentful. But, when it came to the individual panels themselves I was inspired by the short film that played before Moana where it shows a similar story (just without the killing) specifically the scene where the main character enters his workplace and there are people at desks in a grid like manner around him and the shot captures the entire office from wall to wall and shows a window behind him. </p>
                <h1>How We made the website</h1>
                <p>I worked with 3 other members to make the entire website. I was responsible for the illustrations and the ideating whereas the created the website elements, sounds, and collecting stock images such as the background behind each comic strip.</p>
                <p>I worked with: Jihad (https://github.com/TheViision), Marija (https://github.com/marijatomevska), and Linda (https://github.com/LindaD1234), all of whom were far more experienced than I was, so I was very fortunate to have them as it meant I had full reign when it came to illustrations and could spend as much time as I want (and I spent a lot...).</p>
                <h1>Future</h1>
                <p>I really loved working on this project, its by far my favourite out of any of the websites I was apart of making in my Communications Lab course and because of that I learned how website development / graphic design could be fun. Because I had spent hours on Adobe Illustrator turning my sketches to vector graphics I became far more familiar with Illustrator, similarly, it was the first time I was working in a group of 4 on a website and I learned a lot in regard to teamwork, and how to use GitHub as a result. The main mistake that we made in this website was the lack of a credits page. You'll notice for the later assignments that there was a credits page.</p>
