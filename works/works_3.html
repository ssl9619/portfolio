                <h1>Fly 2 D2</h1>
                <p>As part of a project from my Communications Lab course we were divided into groups of four then we had to come up with a story where we could use sounds as our main feature on our website. For this project our group came up with the idea to follow the story of a fly that goes around D2 and that on the website there would be an image that would get less blurry as the viewer scrolled down and the viewer would have to guess what area in D2 they were in.</p>

                <h1>Inspiration</h1>
                <p>Unlike the Overtime project I was not responsible for ideating. Instead, our group had got the idea because they were inspired by the idea of having sounds of cooking and the ambient noise in D2 so it felt like an obvious choice on a place to record sound.</p>
                <h1>How We made the website</h1>
                <p>I along with Vahagn (https://github.com/Vayer88) worked on the website itself. We began first by creating the blur effect. We convened at the library cafe to start work but neither of us were sure on where to start regarding the blur effect. We had some ideas but not really. First we thought to use mostly Javascript but as we were each doing our research together we found that there was a blur effect built into CSS and after that it became easier to do. Once we figured out the blur effect we worked on some minor details with regard to the blur effect like how much, when it should reach zero etc. Then Linda (https://github.com/LindaD1234) was responsible for the recordings and any stock sounds and alongside it Vahagn added some text to further add to the story and Ian was responsible for the hexagon effect and images</p>
                <h1>Future</h1>
                <p>This was one of my less liked projects. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with it but personally I felt a bit out of place. That was primarily because I was not yet strong enough at programming websites to where I felt comfortable doing all the effects that Linda suggested for the website. Had it not been for working with Vahagn I would have not been able to contribute much and it is also because of him that I have since improved.</p>
                <p>I also didn't really resonate with the story, I felt we could have added some details to maybe make it more interesting but looking back I realize that by picking a simple idea it made it easy to improve on our skills as we wouldn't be giving ourselves unnecesary work as now it was further into the semester and work was piling on for all of us.</p>
